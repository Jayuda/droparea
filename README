droparea is a HTML5 drag and drop image/file jQuery plug-in and a php script for 
server-side.

I added:

  * client side image resizing with canvas on browser option
  * data url option for sending a file/image as a text field with ajax
  * on click file browsing

I developed it to use on my Uygulama project new version.
I've only tested it on Chromium (14.0.835.202), Google Chrome (15.0.874.120) and
 Mozilla Firefox (3.6.17) "with some bugs" and it works enough for me for now!
